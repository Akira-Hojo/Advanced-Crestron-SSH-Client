SIMPL+ / SIMPL# SSH Client module

Fork of the frasermclean SSH client module with added features and code comments.

Uses the other call loading form of sshClient in S# which allows you to do custom port numbers. This is honestly kind of a hacky job but I think the layout of the files will be easy for people to use for their own designs.

SIMPL+ module expanded to allow login details from multiple methods, either in a data reference, or from a serial/analog I/O pin with a flag to set which method can be used.

You can expand this even further by integrating it with another system module.

** From Original Readme **
